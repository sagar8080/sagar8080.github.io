								<p>Hey There,</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									I am Sagar Das, a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a master's degree in information management. 
									My core interests lie in data science and engineering methods, along with MLOps and DevOps. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									If I were to pinpoint where my fascination with data started, it would probably be my undergraduate days at Panjab University, Chandigarh, India.  
									After completing a couple of projects in college that involved Python, SQL, machine learning, and cloud computing, I felt this was the path I would like to take professionally.  
									Data engineering seemed like the perfect path for me, as I was able to not only think from a user's perspective but also from a technical standpoint, which has helped me immensely navigate the challenges of building a modern data stack. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									I started out as an intern at a cloud engineering startup and eventually quit my last role as a senior software engineer to pursue higher studies. More about my professional career can be found <a href="#work">here</a>. 
									After obtaining a couple of years of experience, I wanted to deepen my understanding of the data landscape, and I aim to transition into a full-fledged data professional.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Apart from tech, I like to spend my time playing football/soccer. I am also an avid fan of the English football team - Liverpool Football Club, I try not to miss a single match telecast to the best of my schedule. I also like to spend time outdoors, capture landscape shots while I am at it and enjoy hiking/biking trips every now and then.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Ciao!</p>
